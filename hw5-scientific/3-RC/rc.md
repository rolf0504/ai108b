\
The RC circuit looks like:\

When the switch is on position 1, the circuit is in a transient state and the current will be 0 while the capacitor voltage(*Vc*) is equivalent to the power voltage(*V0*), which is *z*V\
The speed that current or voltage drops is determined on the RC time constant *T*\
When *t* = *RC* = *T*
